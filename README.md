# Ergonomic Split and Unibody 42-key Keyboards

Split and unibody variants of an ergonomic (column staggered) 42-key keyboard inspired by the [Cantor](https://github.com/diepala/cantor) keyboard and designed using [ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen).

It uses a firmware based on [keyberon](https://github.com/TeXitoi/keyberon).
